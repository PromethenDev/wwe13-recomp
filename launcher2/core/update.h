// Launcher auto-updater: check GitHub for a newer release, download it, verify it and replace only the
// program files while keeping everything that belongs to the player (saves, game files, settings, music,
// logs, backups). No UI code lives here; the SDL3 + Dear ImGui front end owns the banner and progress.
//
// The check contacts only https://api.github.com and the release download URL that the API returns
// (github.com and its asset hosts). A test-only environment override (WWE13_UPDATE_API_URL) lets a local
// HTTP server stand in for GitHub and is the only case where plain http is accepted.
